4.0 microseconds in p2_1

4.0 - 3.7(<- obtained in aula6/2.c) = 0.3 microseconds

300 nanoseconds used in interrupt prologue process

600 nanoseconds measured in p2_2

600 nanoseconds used in going back to while loop(epilogue)

thus 600 + 300 = 900 nanoseconds in order to use interrupt function (without adc conversions)
