1 DONE Check if vector isn't given as field in vector (easier to change grammar)
2 DONE Check if point is actually a vector (grammar allows it to be expr, which means single numbers are allowed)
3 DONE Check if complete DFA is actually complete (no transitions missing)
4 DONE Check if all variables are declared
5 DONE Check if has one and only one initial state
6 DONE Check if key_values used in grid statement and in place statement are valid.
7 DONE Check if declared statements are placed in the viewport
8 DONE Check if automaton does not break DFA rules when it is declared as such
